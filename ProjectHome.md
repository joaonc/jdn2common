This is a set of functionality written in C# for .NET Framework 2.0.

There's nothing here out of the box that you can use. It's a set of classes that complement .Net 2.0 that help with what you're doing.
This is something I've been working on as my personal toolkit and decided to put it out there for everyone to use.

I've upgraded to VS 2012/.Net 4.5 and created a new project called "jdn45common" which starts with the code from here. Don't plan on continuing development in this .Net 2.0 project and rather will continue in the .Net 4.5 project.
